<p>Hello there. After 7 months of depression and writer's block I am here again to write something new.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/yj5UdA4elp8Wc/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>And today I am going to discuss how I created this website. It is not like a guide or something, it is just you and me chatting. Where I tell and you listen.</p><p>It took me 9 months to get this website complete. But you can make the exact same thing in less than a week using a trick. And we are going to talk about that trick for a while.</p><p>So, why did it take you so long( You might wonder )? Actually, the works I did on this website are very minor but to make everything perfect I had to remake and redesign some important sections of this website.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3dj09hpsfuYkijDi/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>Let's begin. I created this website four times. First, I tried to use Google's blogging platform known as <b>Blogger</b>. The website was very stable and it was quite fast. But there was little to no customisation available. So, I had to shift to a different platform.</p><p>Secondly, I created my website in <b>WordPress</b>. It was highly customisable and I created it with a very standard looking theme. At first the website loading time was quite good but after making some tweaks and installing some plugins the website got heavier. Then when I tried to load the website it was awfully slow. And I was sure that I had to find another alternative.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4pLXMFYQmTM2se7m/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>This was the third time and I was really exhausted. I searched for months online but couldn't find a good alternative and soon I became hopeless. But one day when I was casually surfing YouTube I discovered a video on <b>Hugo</b> (a static site generator). After watching how fast his website was, I was thrilled to create my website with Hugo. I created my third website Hugo and it was awfully simple to customise. Also it was loading like a jaguar. But the major problem I faced was that it lacked very much in features. There wasn't enough plugin available and it couldn't do those tasks that are necessary for a professional website. By then I knew that I had to find another alternative but this time I was hopeful.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/37QADdG7V5bo9ToyCX/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>On the fourth time I researched mainly about types of static websites. I read in detail about most of the well known Static Site Generators out there. And I realized that <b>GatsbyJS</b> was the perfect fit for me. Because it was written in ReactJS and I had basic knowledge of ReactJS. Gatsby was extremely fast and fully feature loaded. I watched videos on YouTube, read some articles on the Web and I was ready to create my website. At least this is what I thought. I created my GatsbyJS website with many problems here and there but I was able to solve all of them by myself.</p><p>There are lots of small details on the website that people don't even notice but those small details took the majority of the time. Here are some examples: There are two types of pop-up on my website. The first one is only for desktops, the pop-up pops up when someone tries to exit the website and it is called "Exit Pop-up". The second one is for mobiles, the pop-up pops up after a certain amount of time. And this pop-up has two dimensions. One for tablet and one for mobile. </p><p>There is also a chat icon on the bottom right of the website which allows my visitors to engage with me if there is something necessary. There is also a subscription modal which pops up to collect subscribers for me, by far this took the most time to set up properly.</p><p>Not only that but I have added some features for SEO also. I have added sitemap to my website so Google can find new updates on my website easily.</p><p>Let's be real for a second, website design takes the majority of the time of website creation. Sometimes it can even take years to make a website design feel perfect. Even though it looks perfect, it definitely doesn't mean that it feels perfect. I also did a lot of tweaking to make it feel perfect to me.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Je48gRANbdX8Kdi/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>Every part of this website is highly customised to my needs. This website is created completely by my own taste. Now here is the trick, you can ask me for my source code of this website and if I give you then one week will be enough time for you to customise the design of this website to your taste because technically this website is perfect for professional blogging. There is no change needed on the technical part.</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/g9582DNuQppxC/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="auto" margin="auto" alt="TahsinProduction Tahsin Production"><p>Have an awesome day, Cheers!!!</p>
