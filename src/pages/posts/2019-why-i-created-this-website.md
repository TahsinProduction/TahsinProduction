This post will be about why I created this website and what was the motivation behind it. I am little bit busy now so will write about it soon.....<h1><center>Introduction</center></h1>Hello, I believe you are having a boring day so that is why you are here. This post is about why I created this website. So, if you don't want to waste your time then please leave. There is nothing informational in this post. But if you want to read the background story then stick with it. Believe me it will be fun.<h1><center>So, you might ask why I created this website?</center></h1>

<i>(You might ask)</i>I am a frequent internet user. Most of the time I am on the internet learning how to do things and reading articles. Sometimes I read more than 30 articles in a day. So you can say I gather too much knowledge in a day, which is true. But in the process of gaining this knowledge I come across many problems like on the title it's showing, "10 homemade foods for your chicken" and when I read the article it's all about chicken foods in the market. Totally different thing. Some just copy another article and paste into their website. Some people do review but fake review. Some gives life hacks without even applying those hacks on themselves. Some tell amazing methods of doing something which never even worked for them. All of this eats up your time as it did mine and by reading this kind of article our time goes to complete waste. Sometimes there isn't enough information on the internet for doing a certain process, it doesn't say step by step which can be difficult for a new user. Example: Once I tried to create a raspberry pi project and it was my first time with Linux. There a guide on the internet and it wasn't detailed so I end up learning a lot of stuff by myself which ate up a lot of my time. There are a lot of paid courses on the internet and sometimes these courses turn out to be a waste of time.<h1><center>Conclusion</center></h1>

I make plans and I do a lot of research and then I try out things on myself. So I will write my experience here. And after doing a lot of search I found a community in which people are extremely good, always willing to help others (which they pass to me too). And these are one of the world's most intelligent people who are trying out new all the time so we get updated data. But most of the data is confidential. My motive is to make your worth every millisecond of the time you take to read stuff in my website.<h1><center>Important</center></h1>If you are planning to join the community then just forget about it. It's invite only kind of a thing. And you have to prove your intelligence to get into this. And it is not even in the regular internet so finding the community is the most hard part nearly impossible. <strong>Don't waste your time trying.</strong>
