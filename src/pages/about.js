<h1 className="mytext">About US</h1>
<h2 className="mytext">Founding</h2>
<p className="mytext"><strong>TAQOA</strong> was founded by <strong>Tahsin in 2004</strong>. It started as a blog but quickly evolved to something huge as more people started joining to make something <strong>valuable</strong>. Everyone connected instantly because each and everyone of them had the same dream. And the dream was to put a <strong>tremendous</strong> amount of value on people who wish to consume valuable content from the internet. There are many different parts of this service and rather than all the parts being managed by a single person, the different parts are managed by these <strong>amazing</strong> different people. Even though you can’t see the names of these people, they are working hard from the backend to run this service <strong>efficiently</strong>.</p>
<h2 className="mytext">Our Mission</h2>
<p className="mytext">At <strong>TAQOA</strong>, we believe there is a better way for consumers to consume valuable content. A more valuable, less invasive way where consumers are<strong> </strong>equipped with seamless content consumption experience. We're <strong>obsessively passionate</strong> about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it.</p>
<p className="mytext">Today, we’re proud to be one of the <strong>world’s largest and smartest</strong> content creation services. In more than <strong>195 countries</strong> across the world, we aspire to excel in service – to our consumers. That’s what <strong>leadership</strong> means to us. Because we want to lead the future generation for a brighter path.</p>
<p className="mytext">At <strong>TAQOA</strong> we don’t care about anything except <strong>“CC”</strong>. It doesn’t mean we care about your Credit Card, because we don’t. <strong>“CC”</strong> stands for Consumer and content which is most valuable for us.</p>
<p className="mytext">The main goal is not to make our website valuable but to help our consumers to get the most value for their time. We hope you enjoy our service as much as we enjoy offering them to you.</p>
<h2 className="mytext">Our Heritage and Ongoing Commitment</h2>
<p className="mytext">When <strong>TAQOA</strong> was founded in <strong>2020</strong>, the people who were working on it had no idea how <strong>revolutionary</strong> this new “service” would be for consumers who want to consume valuable content.</p>
<p className="mytext"><strong>Our founders’ vision</strong> of one-stop learning for the learn-it-yourselfer came to fruition when they saw the <strong>first test build</strong> of their website on <strong>January 24, 2019</strong>, on their local network. The website and everything went through many updates. As a result of that you can interact with the most polished version. The time spent from that day till today is very exciting. And it is constantly upgrading.</p>
<p className="mytext">Education may begin with the school, but it certainly doesn’t end there. We're constantly innovating and researching ways to help more people to learn more valuable skills, despite which country they are living in.</p>
<p className="mytext">We aspire to create a versatile global village. Then we share our research and data with a variety of international organizations and more to help make the internet valuable for everyone.</p>
<p className="mytext">Remember what it used to be like? Fast, open and free. All the endless information seemed free and less cluttered. Now, the internet has turned into a giant muddy field. Greasy mud that slows you down every time you want to check news, facts, or just gain some new knowledge. And we want to make your experience what it used to be in the old days.</p>
<h2 className="mytext">What We Do</h2>
<p className="mytext">When <strong>TAQOA</strong> first started out, their passion for valuable authentic content drove them to do tons of research, work for many days without sleep, remove all kinds of hobbies and fun from life so that <strong>TAQOA</strong> can offer you "the world's most valuable content". We now serve content all over the world and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into a great service which is completely free for the end user.</p>
<p className="mytext">We’re in the business of making great content and services. But we also work every day to build a better tomorrow.</p>
<p className="mytext">We focus on content consumption experience more than anything. To create valuable content we keep us up-to-date with the technology. Everything gets consistently changed and upgraded to provide a better experience.</p>
<p className="mytext">How do we create some of the world's most advanced, reliable and valuable products? It starts with our advanced detailed research and contribution from a huge amount of people.</p>
<p className="mytext">We’re always looking for ways to improve our operations, always challenging ourselves to innovate, always looking to collaborate, always improving each day in everything we do.</p>
<p className="mytext">We create products by listening and responding to you. Why? Because it’s our belief that our products should do more than help you to learn things online, they should also help you to achieve success in life.</p>
<p className="mytext">We make services that respond to, and anticipate, your needs for the way you live today — with advances in <strong>sustainable skills and advanced knowledge</strong>. There are a lot of ways how our services are improving the world we live in today and long into tomorrow.</p>
<p className="mytext">There is only one <strong>WEB 2.0</strong>. Which is why we developed a line of services that make the best possible use of your valuable time, and why we ensure that our services minimize effort and time consumption while <strong>maximizing efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h2 className="mytext">Our Team</h2>
<p className="mytext">We build content and services that help you and people around you to learn skills fast and effectively. And it's our people who maintain those services. <strong>The team who live and work in the communities where you do</strong>.</p>
<p className="mytext">There are a lot of people in this company doing a lot of different things. There is no project manager for any of the projects we build.</p>
<p className="mytext">Some are writers who are getting the writing work done, some are editors who are editing content in a standard manner, some are developers who are developing new products, some are designers who are designing new graphics that will be used with the new product and other people are doing other work.</p>
<p className="mytext">Sometimes a person from the development department might see graphics and if he has a better idea he approaches the graphic designer and they change the design.</p>
<p className="mytext">In our company everybody is very open about their ideas. There is no need to push someone to get the task done because they do it by themselves by <strong>collaborating</strong> with each other.</p>
<p className="mytext">Because it is not like they do it because they are forced to do but they do it because they love to do.</p>
<p className="mytext">Doesn’t matter which work they do in this company but deep inside they are nothing but creators who love to create things and improvise that <strong>according to consumer feedback</strong>.</p>
